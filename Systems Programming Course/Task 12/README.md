<b>Task no. 12 of the University's course. </b>
<br><br>
The program, `lists_ab.c`, receives an input (standard or via text file) and analyzes the amount of characters in total, and counts the <i>alphanumerical</i> characters as well.
<br><br>
In the program I've used pointers manipulation, including <i>dynamic memory allocation</i> to an array, using the `Malloc` and `Realloc` functions.
