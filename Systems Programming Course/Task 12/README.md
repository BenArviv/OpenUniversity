<b>Task no. 12 of the University's course. </b>
<br><br>
The program, <b><i>lists_ab.c</b></i>, receives an input (standard or via text file) and analyzes the amount of characters in total, and counts the alphanumerical characters as well.
<br><br>
In the program I've used pointers manipulation, including dynamic memory allocation to an array, using the <i>Malloc</i> and <i>Realloc</i> functions.
