<b>Fourth C task</b>
<br><br>
This task includes two questions:<br>
1. <i><b>my_and:</i></b><br>
  This program includes the function `and_all(int, ...)`, which gets a variable amount of positive integers, and returns 
  the <i>bitwise</i> `and &` operator, between all of the integers' bits.<br>
  The `main()` function calls `and_all(int, ...)` four times with different amount of randomly chosen integers, then prints the function's
  result in decimal and hexadecimal bases.
2. <i><b>lists_c:</i></b><br>
  This program gets a <b>text file</b> full of characters, via command line, and assigns the characters into a linked-list nodes (`LENGTH` characters in each node),
  while the amount of characters is <b>unknown</b> and <b>unlimited</b>. <br>
  Afterwards, the program prints the file's characters in a formatted way - `LENGTH` characters in each line (except, maybe, in the last line), while taking care of speciel characters,
  such as `newline \n` and `tab \t`.
