<b>Fourth C task</b>
<br><br>
This task includes two questions:<br>
1. <i><b>my_and:</i></b><br>
  This program includes the function `and_all(int, ...)`, which gets a variable amount of positive integers, and returns 
  the bitwise <i>and</i> `&` operator, between all of the integers' bits.<br>
  The `main()` function calls `and_all(int, ...)` four times with different amount of randomly chosen integers, then prints the function's
  result in decimal and hexadecimal bases.
2. <i><b>lists_c:</i></b><br>
