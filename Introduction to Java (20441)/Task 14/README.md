<b>Task no. 14 for the university. 
Shortly, in this folder there are four algorithms: findSingle(), smallestSubSum(), solutions() and cntTruereg().</b>

<b><i>findSingle()</i></b> gets an array full of couples of numbers and one single number, finds that single and returns it.

<b><i>smallestSubSum()</i></b> gets an array full of integers and another number, and returns the smallest sub array which its sum is bigger than the recieved number.

<b><i>solutions()</i></b> gets a number z and returns the amount of solutions the equation 'x1 + x2 + x3 = z' has. Prints each solution.

<b><i>cntTrueReg()</i></b> gets a double array full of boolean variables, counts the amount of 'true' regions that exist in the matrix. A true region is a sequence of neighboring cells, which all of them have the value 'true'.
