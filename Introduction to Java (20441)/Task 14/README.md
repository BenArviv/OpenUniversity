Task no. 14 for the university. 
Shortly, in this folder there are four algorithms: findSingle(), smallestSubSum(), solutions() and cntTruereg().
findSingle() gets an array full of couples of numbers and one single number, finds that single and returns it.
smallestSubSum() gets an array full of integers and another number, and returns the smallest sub array which its sum is bigger than the recieved number.
solutions() gets a number z and returns the amount of solutions the equation 'x1 + x2 + x3 = z' has. Prints each solution.
cntTrueReg() gets a double array full of boolean variables, counts the amount of 'true' regions that exist in the matrix. A true region is a sequence of neighboring cells, which all of them have the value 'true'.
